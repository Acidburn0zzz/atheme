Some ideas concerning things that we may eventually work on.

command aliases

interruptible commands (so as to make ns_mxcheck lookup async)

vhost request system
1. allow users to request vhosts, opers approve/deny
2. allow opers to offer vhosts, users approve/deny

cidr limits in /os clones

think about additional timestamps for recognized vs identified

account merging?

/cs rename?

more fault codes

/ns ghost does not allow disconnecting a user that does not use a registered
nick but is logged in to an account with a known password (it is possible to
disconnect any user logged in to the same account as you); however, it would be
bad to check the same password against two accounts (nick/login). new syntax?

make sendpass/setpass codes expire after some time

show realhost/ip of other users logged in to same account?
