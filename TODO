Some ideas concerning things that we may eventually work on.

command aliases

interruptible commands (so as to make ns_mxcheck lookup async)

vhost request system
1. allow users to request vhosts, opers approve/deny
2. allow opers to offer vhosts, users approve/deny

cidr limits in /os clones

think about additional timestamps for recognized vs identified

"failed logins since" is misleading
