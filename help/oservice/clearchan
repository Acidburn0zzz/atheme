Help for CLEARCHAN:

CLEARCHAN allows operators with the
channel administration flag to clear
a channel in one of three ways. KICK,
which is the default. KILL, or GLINE.

This command should not be used lightly.

Syntax: CLEARCHAN <#channel> [!KICK|!KILL|!GLINE] <reason>

Example:
    /msg &nick& CLEARCHAN #warez warez is bad, mk?
    /msg &nick& CLEARCHAN #warez !GLINE you were warned!
