Help for RAKILL:

RAKILL allows for regex-based akills,
which are useful for removing clones
or botnets.

Be careful, as regex is very easy to
make mistakes with. Use RMATCH first.

Prefix your pattern with i: to allow
for a case insensetive match.

Syntax: RAKILL <[i:]patternhere> <reasonehere>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RAKILL ^moocow! No moocows allowed.
    /msg &nick& RAKILL i:^m[oo|00]cow
