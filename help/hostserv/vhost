Help for VHOST:

VHOST allows operators to set a virtual host (also
known as a spoof or cloak) on a nick. This vhost
will be set on the user immediately and each time
they identify when using said nick. If no vhost is 
specified, revert to the account's vhost.

Syntax: VHOST <nickname> [<vhost>]

Examples:
    /msg &nick& VHOST spb may.explode.on.impact
    /msg &nick& VHOST nenolod
