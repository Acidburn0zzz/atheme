Help for SET RESTRICTED:

SET RESTRICTED designates a channel as restricted access.
Users who are not on the access list of the channel, or
who do not have the chan:joinstaffonly privilege
immediately kickbanned from the channel, removing any
ban exceptions matching them first. If the channel
is set +i, no ban will be set and invite exceptions
will be removed.

Syntax: SET <#channel> RESTRICTED ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET #snoop RESTRICTED ON
