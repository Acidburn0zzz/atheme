Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

1. Will you implement SQL support?

No, there are many impracticalities with SQL support, such as:

 - the inability to properly validate data being inserted back
   into the database

 - cache invalidation (caching would be needed to ensure
   performance)

The only gain would be easier web integration, but you can do
that with XMLRPC and authentication modules anyway.

Plus, we strongly believe you should know how your services
are working, so why would we do all the work for you?

2. Which crypto module should I use?

crypto/posix, unless you are importing from anope, in which case
use the module that is appropriate for you.

3. There is an Atheme "0day exploit"?!&%&%@!!

Report it to us.  Do not twitter about it, that is generally not
helpful.  People who publicize 0days before they can be fixed are
also generally known as "assholes."

4. I get a compile error about some .po file thing.

./configure --disable-nls or install gettext and rerun ./configure.
If you want a more interactive experience, use ./setup which prompts
you if you want internationalization support or not.
