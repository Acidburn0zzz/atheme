Fine grained operator privileges
--------------------------------

A few privileges are granted independently of operclasses:

To all IRCops and users with operator{} blocks (has_any_priv()):
	more detailed "not authorized" messages telling which priv they are
	missing, ability to use /os help

To all users with operator{} blocks:
	account does not expire (unlike HOLD, registered channels do);
	this is to avoid someone else registering the account and taking
	the privs

Description of the privileges in operclasses:
