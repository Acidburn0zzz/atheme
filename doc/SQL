SQL Notes
---------

Atheme supports SQL databases. SQL is not "live" for a number of
reasons. Most significantly, better, more portable, and safer
functionality is provided by Atheme's XML-RPC interface.

Schema files are available in the SQL/ directory.

Note that during 0.3 development, several columns changed from
VARCHAR to TEXT.

PostgreSQL
----------

To initialize the database, use:

	psql <database> < atheme_init.sql


Upgrade information:

Note that the several aspects of the schema have changed. Some
information was moved to metadata. The only major issue with this is
with the ENTRYMSG and URL columns in the CHANNELS table. Run
0.3beta2 against your database and the values will be automatically
converted to metadata. Then, it is safe to drop those columns.

Note also that the FAILNUM, LASTFAIL, and LASTFAILON columns in the
ACCOUNTS table have been removed.


MySQL
-----

The MySQL backend is considered experimental. It has not been
well-tested.

It is critical that the database engine used supports transactions.
Specifically, one *cannot* use MyISAM safely; instead, use InnoDB or
BDB.
